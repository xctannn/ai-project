#### Question 1 - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
This question utilizes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the problem of creating amazing holiday sets for a kindergarten class. The goal is to allocate a budget, choose appropriate items, and wrap them in color-coded wrappers for boys and girls. The algorithm 
will consider various combinations of items and optimize the selection, crossover and mutation methods.

#### Question 2 - Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
This question formulates the problem of rotating teams for stirring a pot of dodol during a four-day dodol feast in Village ABC as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem. By applying constraints on team assignments and time slots, the CSP solver will generate a feasible schedule 
that ensures each team stirs the pot for at least eight hours and no more than four hours per day.

#### Question 3 - Two Classification and One Cluster analysis program
Given the NBA datasets, the question focuses on analyzing NBA sports data using classification and clustering techniques in Python. 
The classification analysis involve building two models to predict the result of an NBA game based on field goal percentage, assists and rebounds. 
The models will use the decision tree and random forest algorithms.
